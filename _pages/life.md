### Video Games

I am a die-hard video game fan. I started playing StarCraft as my first video game experience since I was five. The very first English word I learnt was **supply depot**.

I then started play League of Legends since S1 and hit 1700 ranked points in S2. My league journey, since S4, yielded to my college entrance exam. But I came back in college with much much more free time to rot in front of my PC.

I hit master in Heroes of the Storm, although nobody played/plays that game xD.

I was invited to a semi-pro championship for Battlefield 1 in Europe! I started a Douyin \(Chinese TikTok\) for my Battlefield content and gained a small population of fans. Then I lost it because I got banned from Douyin :\(.

I started playing Apex Legends since I came to the US. I am a triple-season master!

I still plays a lot of video games! I have hundreds of games in my library. I love making friends in games.

### Basketball

I love playing basketball! I play very causal pick-up games at LA fit and college recs. I have been playing for so many years that I don't even remember. I made a lot of friends on the basketball court!

### Music

I am a Jazz lover. I play a bit saxophone. I am learning guitar too.

### Outdoors

I love camping. Good thing that I moved to the Washinton state. There are so many parks here.
