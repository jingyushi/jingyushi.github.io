#### About Me 

---

I am a Ph.D. candidate (4-th year) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Karthik Ramani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ramani/wordpress/). I obtained my M.S. degree in ECE in [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu), working with [Prof. Patricio Vela](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/patricio-antonio-vela). Prior to that, I studied Instrument Science and Technology in [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm) and became a B.Eng.

My research interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI). Specifically, I study human-AI interaction and its applications across various platforms including Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), Robots, etc. Currently, I am studying the deployment and interaction design of generative AI in AR applications.
