#### About Me 

---

I am a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs in the XR Codec Interaction and Avatar (XRCIA) Action Decoder team.

I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu), under the supervision of [Prof. Karthik Ramani](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ramani/wordpress/). I obtained my M.S. degree in ECE in [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu), working with [Prof. Patricio Vela](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/patricio-antonio-vela). Prior to that, I studied Instrument Science and Technology in [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm) and became a B.Eng.

My research interests lie in the intersection of AI and HCI. Specifically, I study applied CVML algorithms and their applications across various platforms including AR, MR, Robots, etc. I enjoy building interactive systems that utilize the state-of-the-art AI algorithms and designing user-friendly interactions to deploy the AI in real world applications.
