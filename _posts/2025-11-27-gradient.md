Somewhere along the long arc of living,
we stop backpropagating without even noticing—
as if the world no longer sends a signal strong enough
to reach the heart.

Before twenty, my learning rate blazed.
The world was a vast, unmapped loss landscape,
and I—freshly initialized—held chaotic parameters
that spun wildly toward possibility.
Every collision with reality struck hard,
but each strike carved a new direction.

Failed exams, broken loves, brushes with failure,
lost scholarships, closed doors—
those fierce, brutal gradients hurt,
but they moved me.
Momentum carried me through every night,
and I believed:
with enough updates,
I would climb out of the narrow valley I was born into
and reach a shimmering, improbable optimum.

But age has its own quiet way of rearranging things.

At some murky moment I can’t pinpoint,
the gradients thinned.
The signals from the world grew faint,
like echoes traveling through too many layers.
Perhaps this is what they call
the vanishing gradient of youth.

Life became a deep neural maze—
its input still “work hard,”
its output somehow “stay where you are.”
Between them,
the nonlinear shadows of workplace politics,
family origins,
mortgages,
fears too heavy to name—
each layer compressing hope into something smaller.

We grow dim not because nothing happens,
but because everything passes through
too many filters.

And in my longing for stability,
I fear I chose the sigmoid—
smoothing my joys and quieting my sorrows,
compressing the full amplitude of being
into a narrow interval
between 0 and 1.

I no longer burn with anger,
nor blaze with wonder.
My output hovers in a flat calm,
a plateau so smooth
that even the fiercest jolt from the world
barely nudges the derivative.

Now I linger
on this bland, steady curve—
a surface too quiet to be safe,
too stable to be alive.

I know—
I know—
that a touch of randomness
could free me:
a sudden journey without planning,
a leap without certainty,
a noise injection that might knock me
out of this local minimum.

But fear has tuned my optimizer.
The fierce SGD of adolescence
has softened into Adam’s cautious steps.
I’ve even whispered early stopping
into my own ear.

The validation loss will not budge.
And so, silently,
I end the training.

I look into the mirror
and see a model that converged too soon.

In the dataset called “ordinary life,”
I perform with flawless stability.
But the function that once dreamed
of constellations and uncharted seas—
that function has slipped beyond reach.

Perhaps all our lives,
we battle the fading of gradients,
only to settle, finally,
into some quiet basin of the soul
and name it equilibrium.
